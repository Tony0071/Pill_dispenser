Hi, I am new to programming and wondering if someone can help me ?

I am trying to write a program for my school project and getting stuck. I still have some code which is work in progress that I will complete but just trying to get the code to function at the moment, tidying up will come later.

So I am asking for a code to be entered to start the program and asking the user for their name, the program then moves on to the Menu which is working ok, I can select option 1,2,3.... and it loops all ok

However when I try option 8 the program runs ok for the first time of asking then crashes out with a GPIO error, I think the program is stuck in the While statement and not loading in the GPIO definitions at the top of the program.... Also if the user time is True the program crashes on the second cycle 

If anyone can help me with the code I would be extremely grateful, hopefully I have explainned the function ok ?

Thanking you in advance for your help
